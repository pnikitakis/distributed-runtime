# distributed-runtime
University project for Distributed Systems (Spring 2018). 

- Configuraton.py file defines whether the execution will be distributed(True) or not (False).

- For stage A: Set false the Configuraton file.  Use the commands run for implementing the code, list for listing the existings programs and kill for terminating a specific program.

- For stage B: Set true the Configuraton file. Use the same commands as stage A. 

- For stage C: First run the dir.py to get directory's ip and port. Run the runtime.py and <join> <runtime_file> and connect to directory.Use migrate <id> <ip> <port> for sending code to other hosts or the same commands (run , list, kill) as previous stages.
